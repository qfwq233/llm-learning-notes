## 🧪 experiment task
MNIST Handwritten digit classification

## 🎯 experiment destination
-Familiar with the basic training process of PyTorch
-Understand the structure of MLP and the role of optimizer
-Master experimental modification (activation function/optimizer/network layers)

##  📂 documents explanation
- code
  - mnist-cls.py: the version that modified under other people's code
- log/ : the log in the process of training data and visualization results

##  📝 experiment Procedure
**level 1**: Run through other people's code(not upload)
Training with original code, the final accuracy: 97%
**level 2**: renovation
- modify optimizer: SGD -> AdamW
- modify learning rate: 0.01 ->0.001
- modify Number of convolutional layers: 2 -> 3
- Improve accuracy to 99.0%
