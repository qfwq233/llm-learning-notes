   2. split the text of document
   3. transform the chunks to vectors and save into local path
2. prompt
build the prompt text and ensure the answers are all from document
3. chain - a pipeline for linear processing
   1. Hand over the messages generated by prompt to LLM to generate answers
   2. transform the answer into string
4. retrieve_document
search the similar chunks from the local stores based on question
5. chain.invoke
hand over the question and similar chunks to LLM and get the answer
